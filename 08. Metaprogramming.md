# Notes
Metaprogramming can also mean ["program that operate on programs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming). But here it means the set of things that are more about _process_ than they are about writing code. In this lecture, we will look at systems for:
- building and testing your code
- managing dependencies

## Build systems
Programming is more about writing codes. Just like write a paper in LaTeX, some sequence of operations you need to do to go from your inputs (paper content) to outpus (pdf files). These are usually callde "build systems", and there are _many_ of them, which depends on:
- the task at hand,
- your language of preference,
- and the size of the project.

At their core, they are all very similar though. You
- define a number of _dependencies_,
- a number of _targets_,
- _rules_ for going from one to other

You tell the build system that you want a particular target, and its job is to find all the transitive dependencies of that target, and then apply the rules to produce intermediate targets all the way until the final target has been produced.

### `make`
 When
you run `make`, it consults a file called `Makefile` in the current directory. All the targets, their dependencies, and the rules are defined in that file. Let's take a look at one:

```make
paper.pdf: paper.tex plot-data.png
	pdflatex paper.tex

plot-%.png: %.dat plot.py
	./plot.py -i $*.dat -o $@
```
- Each directive (there are two) in this file is a rule for how to produce the `:` left using `:` right.
  - right side things are called dependencies
  - left side things are called target
- The indented block (must be TAB) is a sequence of programs to produce the target from those dependencies.
- The first directive (paper.pdf) also defines the default goal. (only typing `make` without any argument)
  - `make plot-data.png`, it will build `plot-data.png` instead.
- The `%` in a rule is a “pattern”, and will match the same string on the left and on the right.
  - If target `plot-foo.png` is provided, `make` will look for dependencies `foo.dat` and `plot.py`.
  - `$@` is the name of the target. see all special variables [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables)

## Dependency management
At a more macro level, your software projects are likely to have dependencies that are themselves projects. You might depend on:
- installed programs (like `python`), 
- system packages (like `openssl`), or 
- libraries within your programming language (like `matplotlib`).

These days, most dependencies will be available through a _repository_ that hosts a large number of such dependencies in a single place, and provides a convenient mechanism for installing them.
- Ubuntu package repositories for Ubuntu system packages, which you access through the `apt` tool, 
- RubyGems for Ruby libraries, 
- PyPi for Python libraries, or 
- the Arch User Repository for Arch Linux user-contributed packages.

### [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Every version number is of the form: major.minor.patch.
- If a new release does not change the API, increase the patch version.
- If you add to your API in a backwards-compatible way, increase the minor version.
- If you change the API in a non-backwards-compatible way, increase the major version.

### Lock files
A lock file is simply a file that lists the exact version you are _currently_ depending on of each dependency. There are many reasons for this:
- avoiding unnecessary recompiles,
- having reproducible builds, or not 
- automatically updating to the latest version (which may be broken).

An extreme version of this kind of dependency locking is _vendoring_, which is where you copy all the code of your dependencies into your own project.

## Continuous intergration systems
Continuous integration, or CI, is an umbrella term for “stuff that runs whenever your code changes”. They all work in roughly the same way: you add a file to your repository that describes what should happen when various things happen to that repository. As an example of a CI system, the class website is set up using GitHub Pages. Pages is a CI action that runs the Jekyll blog software on every push to `master` and makes the built site available on a particular GitHub domain.

### Testing
- Test suite: a collective term for all the tests
- Unit test: a “micro-test” that tests a specific feature in isolation
- Integration test: a “macro-test” that runs a larger part of the system to check that different feature or components work together.
- Regression test: a test that implements a particular pattern that previously caused a bug to ensure that the bug does not resurface.
- Mocking: to replace a function, module, or type with a fake implementation to avoid testing unrelated functionality. For example, you might “mock the network” or “mock the disk”.

# Exercises
- Most makefiles provide a target called `clean`. This isn't intended to produce a file called `clean`, but instead to clean up any files that can be re-built by make. Think of it as a way to "undo" all of the build steps. Implement a `clean` target for the `paper.pdf` `Makefile` above. You will have to make the target [phony](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html). You may find the [`git ls-files`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-files) subcommand useful. A number of other very common make targets are listed [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Standard-Targets.html#Standard-Targets).
  - A [phony target](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html) is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it is just a name for a `recipe` (indented things) to be executed.
  - `clean` is usually used as a phony target to delete all files in the current directory that are normally created by building the program. See [`standard Targets`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Standard-Targets.html#Standard-Targets)
  - However, the clean target will not work properly if a file named clean is ever created in this directory. Thus, we need `.PHONY: clean`
```make
.PHONY: clean
clean:
        git ls-files -o | xargs rm -f # git ls-files -o will show all untracked files.
```
- \* Take a look at the various ways to **specify version requirements** for dependencies in [Rust's build system](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html). Most package repositories support similar syntax. For each one (caret, tilde, wildcard, comparison, and multiple), try to come up with a use-case in which that particular kind of requirement makes sense.

- Git can act as a simple CI system all by itself. In `.git/hooks` inside any git repository, you will find (currently inactive) files that are run as scripts when a particular action happens. Write a [`pre-commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit) hook that runs `make paper.pdf` and refuses the commit if the `make` command fails. This should prevent any commit from having an unbuildable version of the paper.
```bash
cd .git/hooks
vim pre-commit
```
```bash
#!usr/bin/env zsh

make paper.pdf
```
- \* Set up a simple auto-published page using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Add a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to the repository to run `shellcheck` on any shell files in that repository (here is [one way to do it](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/shellcheck)). Check that it works!

- \* [Build your own](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/building-actions) GitHub action to run [`proselint`](http://proselint.com/) or [`write-good`](https://github.com/btford/write-good) on all the `.md` files in the repository. Enable it in your repository, and check that it works by filing a pull request with a typo in it.
