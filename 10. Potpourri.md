## Keyboard remapping

Some software resources to get started on the topic:
- macOS - [karabiner-elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) or [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)
- Linux - [xmodmap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap) or [Autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
- Windows - Builtin in Control Panel, [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or [SharpKeys](https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/)
- QMK - If your keyboard supports custom firmware you can use [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/) to configure the hardware device itself so the remaps works for any machine you use the keyboard with.

### Exercises

- Remapping on tap vs on hold, e.g. Caps Lock key is remapped to Esc if you quickly tap it, but is remapped to Ctrl if you hold it and use it as a modifier.

I found a [ahk script](https://gist.github.com/volks73/1e889e01ad0a736159a5d56268a300a8) to do this, but it is archieved by listenning the `Cap Up` event. It acts weirdly, e.g. if you only pressed Cap, even more than trigger time, it will still send ESC.

```atk
*CapsLock::
    Send {Blind}{Ctrl Down}
    cDown := A_TickCount
Return

*CapsLock up::
    If ((A_TickCount-cDown)<400)  ; Modify press time as needed (milliseconds)
        Send {Blind}{Ctrl Up}{Esc}
    Else
        Send {Blind}{Ctrl Up}
Return
```

This is what I used. I don't find the solution for the ESC problem so I just use Cap as Ctrl and call it a day.:
```
CapsLock::Control
Escape::CapsLock

*LControl::
    Send {Blind}{Ctrl Down}
    cDown := A_TickCount
Return

*LControl up::
    If ((A_TickCount-cDown)<100)  ; Modify press time as needed (milliseconds)
        Send {Blind}{Ctrl Up}{Esc}
    Else
        Send {Blind}{Ctrl Up}
Return
```

## Daemons

Most computers have a series of processes that are always running in the background rather than waiting for a user to launch them and interact with them. These processes are called daemons and the programs that run as daemons often end with a `d` to indicate so. 

- `sshd` the SSH daemon, is the program responsible for listening to incoming SSH requests and checking that the remote user has the necessary credentials to log in.
- In Linux, `systemd` (the system daemon) is the most common solution for running and setting up daemon processes.
  - You can run `systemctl status` to list the current running daemons.
  - `Systemd` can be interacted with the `systemctl` command in order to `enable`, `disable`, `start`, `stop`, `restart` or check the status of services (those are the `systemctl` commands).
  - It has a fairly accessible interface. Below is an example of a daemon for running a simple Python app.

```bash
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
[Unit]
Description=My Custom App
After=network.target

[Service]
User=foo
Group=foo
WorkingDirectory=/home/foo/projects/mydaemon
ExecStart=/usr/bin/local/python3.7 app.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- `cron` is a daemon your system already runs to perform scheduled tasks.

## FUSE (File system in user space)

When you run `touch` to create a file, `touch` performs a system call to the kernel to create the file and the kernel performs the appropriate filesystem call to create the given file. A caveat is that UNIX filesystems are traditionally implemented as kernel modules and only the kernel is allowed to perform filesystem calls.

[FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) (Filesystem in User Space) allows filesystems to be implemented by a user program. FUSE lets users **run user space code for filesystem calls and then bridges the necessary calls to the kernel interfaces.**
In practice, this means that users can implement arbitrary functionality for filesystem calls.

For example, FUSE can be used so whenever you perform an operation in a virtual filesystem, that operation is forwarded through SSH to a remote machine, performed there, and the output is returned back to you.
This way, local programs can see the file as if it was in your computer while in reality it's in a remote server.
This is effectively what `sshfs` does.

Some interesting examples of FUSE filesystems are:
- [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) - Open locally remote files/folder through an SSH connection.
- [rclone](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) - Mount cloud storage services like Dropbox, GDrive, Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage and open data locally.
- [gocryptfs](https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/) - Encrypted overlay system. Files are stored encrypted but once the FS is mounted they appear as plaintext in the mountpoint.
- [kbfs](https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs) - Distributed filesystem with end-to-end encryption. You can have private, shared and public folders.
- [borgbackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/mount.html) - Mount your deduplicated, compressed and encrypted backups for ease of browsing.

## Backups

- A copy of the data in the same disk is not a backup, because the disk is the single point of failure for all the data.
  - an external drive in your home is also a weak backup solution since it could be lost in a fire/robbery/&c.
  - having an off-site backup is a recommended practice.
- Synchronization solutions are not backups.
  - when data is erased or corrupted they propagate the change.
- Some core features of good backups solutions are versioning, deduplication and security.
  - Versioning backups ensure that you can access your history of changes and efficiently recover files.
  - data deduplication is a efficient backup solutions that only stores incremental changes and reduce the storage overhead.
  - Regarding security, you should ask yourself what someone would need to know/have in order to read your data and, more importantly, to delete all your data and associated backups.
  - blindly trusting backups is a terrible idea and you should verify regularly that you can use them to recover data.
- For a more detailed explanation, see 2019's lecture notes on [Backups](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2019/backups/s).

## API

Most of APIs have a similar format.
- They are structured URLs, often rooted at `api.service.com`.
- path and query parameters indicate what data you want to read or what action you want to perform.
- For the US weather data for example, to get the forecast for a particular location:
  - you issue GET request (with `curl` for example) to `https://api.weather.gov/points/42.3604,-71.094`.
  - The response itself contains a bunch of other URLs that let you get specific forecasts for that region.
  - Usually, the responses are formatted as JSON, which you can then pipe through a tool like `jq` to massage into what you care about.

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is a website and service centered around the idea of APIs — it provides integrations with tons of services, and lets you chain events from them in nearly arbitrary ways. Give it a look.

## Common command-line flags/patterns

Command-line tools vary a lot, and you will often want to check out their `man` pages before using them. They often share some common features though that can be good to be aware of:

 - Most tools support some kind of `--help` flag to display brief usage instructions for the tool.
 - Many tools that can cause irrevocable change support the notion of a "dry run" in which they only print what they _would have done_, but do not actually perform the change. Similarly, they often have an "interactive" flag that will prompt you for each destructive action.
 - You can usually use `--version` or `-V` to have the program print its own version (handy for reporting bugs!).
 - Almost all tools have a `--verbose` or `-v` flag to produce more verbose output. You can usually include the flag multiple times (`-vvv`) to get _more_ verbose output, which can be handy for debugging. Similarly, many tools have a `--quiet` flag for making it only print something on error.
 - In many tools, `-` in place of a file name means "standard input" or "standard output", depending on the argument.
 - Possibly destructive tools are generally not recursive by default, but support a "recursive" flag (often `-r`) to make them recurse.
 - Sometimes, you want to pass something that _looks_ like a flag as a normal argument. For example, imagine you wanted to remove a file called `-r`. Or you want to run one program "through" another, like `ssh machine foo`, and you want to pass a flag to the "inner" program (`foo`). The special argument `--` makes a program _stop_ processing flags and options (things starting with `-`) in what follows, letting you pass things that look like flags without them being interpreted as such: `rm -- -r` or `ssh machine --for-ssh -- foo --for-foo`.

## Windows managers

There is an alternative to the *floating* window manager (Windows use it by default) called *tiling* window manager. In a tiling window manager,
- windows never overlap and are arranged as tiles on your screen like tmux planes.
- The arrangement of windows are called *layout*.
- You can use this to avoid touching yhe mouse (nouse is sloooooow).

## VPNs

- [Don't use VPN services](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29)
- if you're going to roll your own, give [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) a look

## Notebook programming

- Just like Python interpreter, notebook programming environments can be really handy for doing certain types of interactive or exploratory development.
- An exemplar of this is Wolfram Mathematica
- Perhaps the most popular notebook programming environment today is Jupyter, for Python (and several other languages).
- Jupyter can be deployed as a web. Similar to SSH, but it's focused on Python Programming instead of interacting with the OS in shell.

## Q&A

- [0:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=49s) Any recommendations on learning Operating Systems related topics like processes, virtual memory, interrupts, memory management, etc?
  - This doesn't matter unless you are working with low-level code, like kernel.
  - Take a introductory class maybe the best choice. (MIT 6.828)
  - If you just want to udnerstand it at a high level view, check the book "Modern Operating Systems" by Andy Tannenbaum.
- [3:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=193s) What are some of the tools you’d prioritize learning first?
  - Editor
  - Think about things you doing repetitively in current task, find a better way to do it.
  - Version control (Git)
- [6:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=369s) When do I use Python versus a Bash scripts versus some other language?
  - Bash scripts are for automating running a bunch of commands in shell.
  - It is good for a *particular use case*, ;ike, I just want to run these commands, in this order, with some arguments.
  - Write a Bash script if it's less than a hundred lines of code.
  - If the sub-problems are solved in Python, reusing it is easy for Python. Bash is hard for code reuse.
  - If you find a library for that job, use that language.
- [8:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=525s) What is the difference between source script.sh and ./script.sh
  - It's true that they will end up running the script.
  - `source` will run in current  Bash session, whereas the other will Start up a new instance of Bash.
  - If the script will change directory, `source` will change you pwd after the script is finished.
  - If you difine a function in the script, `source` let you use the function afterwards.
- [10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=628s) What are the places where various packages and tools are stored and how does referencing them work? What even is /bin or /lib?
  - `$PATH` are the places where Bash looks for binaries.
  - It's a convention to user programs that use `/usr/bin` as the binary executebale path, at least symlinks.
  - `/bin` are for essential system utilities.
  - `/usr/local/bin` user compiled programs
  - `/sbin` s stands for `sudo`
  - `/etc` for configuration files
  - `/opt` are used for companies ported their software to Linux but they don't actually understand what running software on Linux is like.
- [15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=902s) Should I apt-get install a python-whatever, or pip install whatever package?
  - `apt-get` might be a bit out-of-date.
  - `pip` is more optimized about managing dependencies and compiling.
- [18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=1105s) What’s the easiest and best profiling tools to use to improve performance of my code?
  - keep doing profiling at every lines of code to see which part consumes most of the resource.
  - Valgrind has a tool called cachegrind
  - different languages have different tools: Javascript - WebBrowsers; go - built-in profiler
  - Behold the extra time for io, system calls, networks, and etc. Sometimes they are slow because you arre not using all the computing resource.
  - BPF trace - kernel tracing, low-level debugging.
- [23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=1391s) What browser plugins do you use?
  - uBlock Origin

  - password manager
- [29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=1758s) What are other useful data wrangling tools?
  - curl: making web quests
  - JQ, pup: write queries over JSON and HTML
  - Perl: text processing. easier than combination of grep and awk and sed
  - `column -t`: align columns based on whitespace
  - Vim if you can open it as a file.
  - Python, Jupyter notebook
  - pandoc: transfer between different document formats
  - R: awful, but at the end, you can use it to produce pretty plots. library  `ggplot2`.
  - Example: convert xml to json ([file](/2019/files/example-data.xml))
    - Array of objects with keys "name" / "email"
    - Use a Python program?
    - Use sed / regexes
        - `g/people/d`
        - `%s/<person>/{/g`
        - `%s/<name>\(.*\)<\/name>/"name": "\1",/g`
        - ...
    - Vim commands / macros
        - `Gdd`, `ggdd` delete first and last lines
        - Macro to format a single element (register `e`)
            - Go to line with `<name>`
            - `qe^r"f>s": "<ESC>f<C"<ESC>q`
        - Macro to format a person
            - Go to line with `<person>`
            - `qpS{<ESC>j@eA,<ESC>j@ejS},<ESC>q`

- [34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=2055s) What is the difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine?
  - docker will share the kernel, whereas vm will only share the hardwares
  - dockers require Linux environment
- [37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=2220s) What are the advantages and disadvantages of each OS and how can we choose between them (e.g. choosing the best Linux distribution for our purposes)?
  - For a specific task, distribution is not that important.
  - Some distributions have really frequent updates, which are more likely to break easily. (Arch Linux - rolling update can help this)
  - You want a steady way of updates. (Debian, Ubuntu LTS)
  - Ubuntu is a Debian based distribution. Debian is a little bit more minimalist.
  - If you want to learn more things, trade stability for having more up-to-date software, maybe at the expense of you having to fix a broken distribution every once in while, you can cinsider Arch Linux or Gentoo.
  - If you just want it work, Debian is a great choice.
  - [BSD](http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/01)
  - __If you are a programmer, I don't know why you are using Windows.__
- [41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=2479s) Vim vs Emacs?
- [42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=2530s) Any tips or tricks for Machine Learning applications?
  - Knowing data wrangling and shell tools. 
    - Scientific results need to have reproducible results and logging them in a sensible way,
    - Comparing with using folders to describe the entire experiment, a JSON file is a good way. (parameters management)
    - So data wrangling tools become handy.
    - You need ssh to a machine, so automating the dirty those jobs can save your time and mental energy.
- [43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=2625s) Any more Vim tips?
  - Vim plugins (take at a look at tools that instructors used)
  - leader key
    - You can bind any key to leader key, and you can combine leader key with another key to do some actions.
    - `space+w` to `:w`
  - `m`ark and press any key to mark a file, then press apostrophe`'` on the same letter to jump back to the file
  - `Ctrl+O` can go to the previous location, also works in different files.
  - `:eariler` undos based on time. Plugins undo-tree can help. Option undodir.
  - `D/string` can delete a string pattern. search is a noun.
  - register
- [50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=3041s) What is 2FA and why should I use it?
  - Use U2F instead of SMS.
- [51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50FvGG6xU&t=3097s) Any comments on differences between web browsers?
  - Chrome is great for security reason.
  - Don't use Safari. It's a worse version of Chrome.
  - Flow and Firefox servo.
