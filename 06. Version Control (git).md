# Notes
Modern VCSs also let you easily (and often automatically) answer questions like:
- Who wrote this module?
- When was this particular line of this particular file edited? By whom? Why was it edited?
- *Over the last 1000 revisions*, when/why did a particular unit test stop working?

> While an ugly interface has to be *memorized*, a beautiful design can be *understood*. 

## Git's data model
### Snapshots
Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some top-level directory as a series of snapshots. In Git terminology:
- file - blob
- directory - tree (it maps names to blobs or trees)
- snapshot: the top-level tree that is being tracked.
```
<root> (tree)
|
+- foo (tree)
|  |
|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
|
+- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
```

### Modeling history: relating snapshots
In Git, a history is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of snapshots. All this means is that each snapshot in Git refers to a set of “parents”, the snapshots that preceded it.

Git calls these snapshots “commit”s. Visualizing a commit history might look something like this:
```
o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- o
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- o <-- o
```
- `o` - individual commits
- The arrows point to the parent of each commit
- Commits in Git are immutable. This doesn’t mean that mistakes can’t be corrected.

### Data model, as pseudocode
```
// a file is a bunch of bytes
type blob = array<byte>

// a directory contains named files and directories
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>

// a commit has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
type commit = struct {
    parent: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}
```

### Objectsd and content-addressing
An “object” is a blob, tree, or commit: 
```
type object = blob | tree | commit
```

In Git data store, all objects are content-addressed by their [SHA-1 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1).
```python
objects = map<string, object>

def store(object):
    id = sha1(object)
    objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return objects[id]
```
Blobs, trees, and commits are all objects. When they reference other objects, they don’t actually *contain* them in their on-disk representation, but have a reference to them by their hash.

For example, the tree for the example directory structure above (visualized using `git cat-file -p 698281bc680d1995c5f4caaf3359721a5a58d48d`), looks like this:
```
100644 blob 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85    baz.txt
040000 tree c68d233a33c5c06e0340e4c224f0afca87c8ce87    foo
```
The tree itself contains pointers to its contents, `baz.txt` (a blob) and `foo` (a tree). If we look at the contents addressed by the hash corresponding to `baz.txt` with `git cat-file -p 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85`, we get the following:
```
git is wonderful
```

### Reference
Git’s solution to this problem is human-readable names for SHA-1 hashes, called “references”.
- References are pointers to commits.
- References are mutable. (unlike objects)
- For example, the `master` reference usually points to the latest commit in the main branch of development.
``` python
references = map<string, string>

def update_reference(name, id):
    references[name] = id

def read_reference(name):
    return references[name]

def load_reference(name_or_id):
    if name_or_id in references:
        return load(references[name_or_id])
    else:
        return load(name_or_id)
```
- With this, Git can use human-readable names like “master” to refer to a particular snapshot in the history, instead of a long hexadecimal string.
- “where we currently are” is a special reference called “HEAD”.

### Repositories
Finally, we can define what (roughly) is a Git repository: it is the data `objects` and `references`.
- All Git stores are objects and references.
- All `git` commands map to some manipulation of the commit DAG by adding objects and adding/updating references.
- Whenever you’re typing in any command, think about what manipulation the command is making to the underlying graph data structure.

If you’re trying to make a particular kind of change to the commit DAG, e.g. “discard uncommitted changes and make the ‘master’ ref point to commit `5d83f9e`”, there’s probably a command to do it (e.g. in this case, `git checkout master`; `git reset --hard 5d83f9e`).

### Staging area

## Git command-line interface
Check [`Pro Git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) if the notes don't contain infomation you want.

### Basics
- `git help <command>`: get help for a git command
- `git init`: creates a new git repo, with data stored in the .git directory
- `git status`: tells you what’s going on
- `git add <filename>`: adds files to staging area
- git commit: creates a new commit
  - Write [good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)!
  - Even more reasons to write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- `git log`: shows a flattened log of history
- `git diff <filename>`: show changes you made relative to the staging area
- `git diff <revision> <filename>`: shows differences in a file between snapshots
- `git checkout <revision>`: updates HEAD and current branch

### Branching and merging
- `git branch`: shows branches
- `git branch <name>`: creates a branch
- `git checkout -b <name>`: creates a branch and switches to it
  - same as `git branch <name>; git checkout <name>`
- `git merge <revision>`: merges into current branch
- `git mergetool`: use a fancy tool to help resolve merge conflicts
- `git rebase`: rebase set of patches onto a new base

### Remotes
- `git remote`: list remotes
- `git remote add <name> <url>`: add a remote
- `git push <remote> <local branch>:<remote branch>`: send objects to remote, and update remote reference
- `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<remote branch>`: set up correspondence between local and remote branch
- `git fetch`: retrieve objects/references from a remote
- `git pull`: same as git fetch; git merge
- `git clone`: download repository from remote

### Undo
- `git commit --amend`: edit a commit’s contents/message
- `git reset HEAD <file>`: unstage a file
- `git checkout -- <file>`: discard changes

### Advanced Git
- `git config`: Git is highly customizable
- `git clone --depth=1`: shallow clone, without entire version history
- `git add -p`: interactive staging
- `git rebase -i`: interactive rebasing
- `git blame`: show who last edited which line
- `git stash`: temporarily remove modifications to working directory
- `git bisect`: binary search history (e.g. for regressions)
- `.gitignore`: specify intentionally untracked files to ignore

## Miscellaneous
- **GUIs**: there are many [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) out there for Git. We personally don’t use them and use the command-line interface instead.
- **Shell integration**: it’s super handy to have a Git status as part of your shell prompt (zsh, bash). Often included in frameworks like Oh My Zsh.
- **Editor integration**: similarly to the above, handy integrations with many features. [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is the standard one for Vim.
- **Workflows**: we taught you the data model, plus some basic commands; we didn’t tell you what practices to follow when working on big projects (and there are [many](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) [different](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful) [approaches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)).
- **GitHub**: Git is not GitHub. GitHub has a specific way of contributing code to other projects, called [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
- **Other Git providers: GitHub is not special**: there are many Git repository hosts, like GitLab and BitBucket.

# Exercises
## 2
- Clone the repository for the class website.
```
git clone https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester.git
```
- Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph.
```
git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline
```
- Who was the last person to modify `README.md`? (Hint: use `git log` with an argument).
```bash
git log --all --graph --decorate README.md
# The top one
```
- What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the `collections`: line of `_config.yml`? (Hint: use `git blame` and `git show`).
```bash
git blame _config.yml
/collections
# get the hash of the modification, in this case a88b
git show a88b4eac _config.yml
```
## 3
- One common mistake when learning Git is to commit large files that should not be managed by Git or adding sensitive information. Try adding a file to a repository, making some commits and then deleting that file from history (you may want to look at [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)).
  - `git filter-branch` command or the BFG Repo-Cleaner open source tool.
  - it will change the SHAs for existing commits that you alter *and any dependent commits*.
  - merging or closing all open pull requests before removing files from your repository.
  - If you run `git filter-branch` after stashing changes, you won't be able to retrieve your changes with other stash commands.
### [Removing sensitive data from a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)
```bash
$ git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline
* 8ab4870 (HEAD -> master) commit2
* 0c1a08e commit1
* 9720f73 add sensitive-data
*   91fb22c (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'

$ git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch sensitive-data" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

* c1b1e59 (HEAD -> master) commit2
* 8c44802 commit1
*   4f42fa0 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'
```
### [Removing a file added in the most recent unpushed commit](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history)
```bash
$ git rm --cached <file_name> # This won't remove the file in the file system.
$ # fix the error
$ git commit --amend -CHEAD # -CHEAD = -C HEAD
# Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information (including the timestamp) when creating the commit.
# If you want to use a new message, change it with -m '<new message>'
```

### Back to the parent commit as current commit doesn't exist
```
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

A conclusion to this will be: if your mistakes affects more than one commit or it has already pushed, do the first one.

## 4
```bash
$ git log --all --oneline
91fb22c (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'
61c1e2a add two punctuation marks
bd5d105 Merge branch 'waynezhangw/tinyFix'
```
- What happens when you do `git stash`?
```bash
$ touch 'stash test'
$ git add .
$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 91fb22c Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'
# edited file returns to the last commit state
$ git log --all --oneline
db812b6 (refs/stash) WIP on master: 91fb22c Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'
2922753 index on master: 91fb22c Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'
91fb22c (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'
```
- Run `git stash pop` to undo what you did with git stash.
```bash
$ git stash pop
$ git log
91fb22c (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge branch 'letian-jiang/improve-version-control'
61c1e2a add two punctuation marks
bd5d105 Merge branch 'waynezhangw/tinyFix'
# Back to previous state
```
- In what scenario might this be useful?

It's like a half-done commit. When you want to switch to other branches/commits, any uncommit changes will lose. So if you want to switch to other branches/commits, this can store the chages but not commit them.

## 5
Create an alias in `~/.gitconfig` so that when you run `git graph`, you get the output of `git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline`.
```
[alias]
        graph = log --all --graph --decorate --oneline
```

## 6
You can define global ignore patterns in `~/.gitignore_global` after running `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`. Do this, and set up your global gitignore file to ignore OS-specific or editor-specific temporary files, like `.DS_Store`.
