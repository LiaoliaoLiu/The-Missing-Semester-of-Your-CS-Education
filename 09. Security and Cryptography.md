# Notes
We will focus on security and cryptography concepts that are relevant in understanding tools covered earlier in this class:
- hash functions in Git
- key derivation functions
- symmetric/asymmetric cryptosystems in SSH

Don't do security work without formal training in security. Unless you're an expert, don't [roll your own crypto](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/05/amateurs_produc.html). The same principle applies to systems security. This lecture won’t be enough to teach you how to _design_ secure systems or cryptographic protocols, but we hope it will be enough to give you a general understanding of the programs and protocols you already use.

## Entropy
> Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computer to guess.

“correcthorsebatterystaple” is more secure than one like “Tr0ub4dor&3”. But how do you quantify something like this?

Entropy is measured in bits, and when selecting uniformly at random from a set of possible outcomes, the entropy is equal to `log_2(# of possibilities)`.
- A fair coin flip gives 1 bit of entropy. 
- A dice roll (of a 6-sided die) has ~2.58 bits of entropy.

You should consider that the attacker knows the _model_ of the password, but not the randomness (e.g. from [dice
rolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware)) used to select a particular password.
- For online guessing, \~40 bits of entropy is pretty good.
- To be resistant to offline guessing, a stronger password would be necessary (e.g. 80 bits, or more).

## Hash functions
A [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed size, and has some special properties. A rough specification of a hash function is as follows:

```
hash(value: array<byte>) -> vector<byte, N>  (for some fixed N)
```

An example of a hash function is [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1), which is used in Git. It maps arbitrary-sized inputs to 160-bit outputs (which can be represented as 40 hexadecimal characters). We can try out the SHA1 hash on an input using the `sha1sum` command:

```console
$ printf 'hello' | sha1sum
aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d
$ printf 'hello' | sha1sum
aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d
$ printf 'Hello' | sha1sum 
f7ff9e8b7bb2e09b70935a5d785e0cc5d9d0abf0
```

At a high level, a hash function can be thought of as a hard-to-invert random-looking (but deterministic) function (and this is the [ideal model of a hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle)). A hash function has the following properties:

- Deterministic: the same input always generates the same output.
- Non-invertible: it is hard to find an input `m` such that `hash(m) = h` for some desired output `h`.
- Target collision resistant: given an input `m_1`, it's hard to find a different input `m_2` such that `hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)`.
- Collision resistant: it's hard to find two inputs `m_1` and `m_2` such that `hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)` (note that this is a strictly stronger property than target collision resistance).

Note: while it may work for certain purposes, SHA-1 is [no longer](https://shattered.io/) considered a strong cryptographic hash function.  You might find this table of [lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions](https://valerieaurora.org/hash.html) interesting. However, note that recommending specific hash functions is beyond the scope of this lecture. If you are doing work where this matters, you need formal training in security/cryptography.

## Hash functions applications

- Git, for content-addressed storage. The idea of a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is a more general concept (there are non-cryptographic hash functions). Why does Git use a cryptographic hash function?
- A short summary of the contents of a file. Software can often be downloaded from (potentially less trustworthy) mirrors, e.g. Linux ISOs, and it would be nice to not have to trust them. The official sites usually post hashes alongside the download links (that point to third-party mirrors), so that the hash can be checked after downloading a file.
- [Commitment schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme).  Suppose you want to commit to a particular value, but reveal the value itself later. For example, I want to do a fair coin toss "in my head", without a trusted shared coin that two parties can see. I could choose a value `r = random()`, and then share `h = sha256(r)`. Then, you could call heads or tails (we'll agree that even `r` means heads, and odd `r` means tails). After you call, I can reveal my value `r`, and you can confirm that I haven't cheated by checking `sha256(r)` matches the hash I shared earlier.

## Key derivation functions

A related concept to cryptographic hashes, [key derivation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) (KDFs) are used for a number of applications, including
- producing *fixed-length output* for use as keys in other cryptographic algorithms. 
- Usually, KDFs are _deliberately slow_, in order to slow down offline brute-force attacks.

### Applications

- Producing keys from passphrases for use in other cryptographic algorithms
- Storing login credentials. 
  - Storing plaintext passwords is bad; 
  - the right approach is to generate and store a random [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) `salt = random()` for each user, 
  - store `KDF(password + salt)`, and verify login attempts by re-computing the KDF given the entered password and the stored salt.

## Symmetric cryptography

Hiding message contents is probably the first concept you think about when you think about cryptography. Symmetric cryptography accomplishes this with the following set of functionality:

```
keygen() -> key  (this function is randomized)

encrypt(plaintext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the ciphertext)
decrypt(ciphertext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the plaintext)
```

The encrypt function has the property that given the output (ciphertext), it's hard to determine the input (plaintext) without the key. The decrypt function has the obvious correctness property, that `decrypt(encrypt(m, k), k) = m`.

An example of a symmetric cryptosystem in wide use today is [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

### Applications

- Encrypting files for storage in an untrusted cloud service. This can be combined with KDFs, so you can encrypt a file with a passphrase. Generate `key = KDF(passphrase)`, and then store `encrypt(file, key)`.


## Asymmetric cryptography

Asymmetric cryptosystems provide the following set of functionality, to encrypt/decrypt and to sign/verify:

```
keygen() -> (public key, private key)  (this function is randomized)

encrypt(plaintext: array<byte>, public key) -> array<byte>  (the ciphertext)
decrypt(ciphertext: array<byte>, private key) -> array<byte>  (the plaintext)

sign(message: array<byte>, private key) -> array<byte>  (the signature)
verify(message: array<byte>, signature: array<byte>, public key) -> bool  (whether or not the signature is valid)
```

Symmetric and asymmetric encryption can be compared to physical locks. A symmetric cryptosystem is like a door lock: anyone with the key can lock and unlock it. Asymmetric encryption is like a padlock with a key. You could give the unlocked lock to someone (the public key), they could put a message in a box and then put the lock on, and after that, only you could open the lock because you kept the key (the private key).

The sign/verify functions have the same properties that you would hope physical signatures would have, in that it's hard to forge a signature. No matter the message, without the _private_ key, it's hard to produce a signature such that `verify(message, signature, public key)` returns true. And of course, the verify function has the obvious correctness property that `verify(message, sign(message, private key), public key) = true`.

### Applications

- [PGP email encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy).  People can have their public keys posted online (e.g. in a PGP keyserver, or on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/)). Anyone can send them encrypted email.  
- Private messaging. Apps like [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) use asymmetric keys to establish private communication channels.
- Signing software. Git can have GPG-signed commits and tags. With a posted public key, anyone can verify the authenticity of downloaded software.

## Key distribution

Asymmetric-key cryptography is wonderful, but it has a big challenge of distributing public keys / mapping public keys to real-world identities. There are many solutions to this problem.
- Signal has one simple solution: trust on first use, and support out-of-band public key exchange (you verify your friends’ “safety numbers” in person).
- PGP has a different solution, which is [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust). 
- Keybase has yet another solution of [social proof](https://keybase.io/blog/chat-apps-softer-than-tofu) (along with other
neat ideas). (instructors' choice)

## Case studies
### Password managers
### Two-factor authentication
### Full disk encryption
### Private messaging
### SSH

When you run `ssh-keygen`, it generates an asymmetric keypair, `public_key, private_key`. 
- This is generated randomly, using entropy provided by the operating system (collected from hardware events, etc.). 
- The public key is stored as-is (.pub file), 
- but at rest, the private key should be encrypted on disk. 
- The `ssh-keygen` program prompts the user for a passphrase, and this is fed through a key derivation function to produce a key, which is then used to encrypt the private key with a symmetric cipher.

In use, once the server knows the client's public key (stored in the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file), a connecting client can prove its identity using asymmetric signatures. This is done through [challenge-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication).  At a high level, 
1. the server picks a random number and sends it to the client.  
2. The client then signs this message and sends the signature back to the server, which checks the signature against the public key on record. 
3. This effectively proves that the client is in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key that's in the server's `.ssh/authorized_keys` file, so the server can allow the client to log in.

# Exercises


## **Entropy.**

1. Suppose a password is chosen as a concatenation of four lower-case dictionary words, where each word is selected uniformly at random from a dictionary of size 100,000. An example of such a password is `correcthorsebatterystaple`. How many bits of entropy does this have?
    
This depends on the pattern. If hacker knows that you used __4__ words from the dictionary (size of *100,000*), The entropy would be:

$$
log_2 100,000 *4 \approx 66.44
$$

But if the hacker has no idea about the dictionary things. Then the pattern would be

$$
log_2 T * N \\
log_2 62 * 25 = 148
$$

where T is the number of total characters in the set, e.g. $26(a-z) + 26(A-Z) + 10(0-9) = 62(T)$; N is the number of characters of the password, here is $7+5+7+6=25$

2. Consider an alternative scheme where a password is chosen as a sequence of 8 random alphanumeric characters (including both lower-case and upper-case letters). An example is `rg8Ql34g`. How many bits of entropy does this have?
3. Which is the stronger password?
4. Suppose an attacker can try guessing 10,000 passwords per second. On average, how long will it take to break each of the passwords?

## Cryptographic hash functions.

Download a Debian image from a [mirror](https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/) (e.g. [from this Argentinean mirror](http://debian.xfree.com.ar/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/).  Cross-check the hash (e.g. using the `sha256sum` command) with the hash retrieved from the official Debian site (e.g. [this file](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA256SUMS) hosted at `debian.org`, if you've downloaded the linked file from the Argentinean mirror).

## Symmetric cryptography.

Encrypt a file with AES encryption, using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/): `openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -in {input filename} -out {output filename}`. Look at the contents using `cat` or `hexdump`. Decrypt it with `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in {input filename} -out {output filename}` and confirm that the contents match the original using `cmp`.

## Asymmetric cryptography.

1. Set up [SSH keys](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2) on a computer you have access to (not Athena, because Kerberos interacts weirdly with SSH keys). Rather than using RSA keys as in the linked tutorial, use more secure [ED25519 keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#Ed25519). Make sure your private key is encrypted with a passphrase, so it is protected at rest.
2. [Set up GPG](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-and-sign-messages)
3. Send Anish an encrypted email ([public key](https://keybase.io/anish)).
4. Sign a Git commit with `git commit -S` or create a signed Git tag with `git tag -s`. Verify the signature on the commit with `git show --show-signature` or on the tag with `git tag -v`.
